# Password Generator

A simple and responsive password generator built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## Features

- Generate secure random passwords
- Customize password length
- Include:
  - Uppercase letters (A-Z)
  - Lowercase letters (a-z)
  - Numbers (0-9)
  - Special characters (!@#$%^&*...)

## How it Works

This project uses JavaScript to randomly select characters from different sets (letters, numbers, symbols). The password is generated each time you click the "Generate" button.

### Password Generation Logic

We improved the generator to:
- Use `Math.random()` with a mix of character sets
- Shuffle the final password to enhance randomness
- Ensure at least one character from each selected type is included

Example code logic:

```javascript
const upper = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
const lower = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";
const numbers = "0123456789";
const symbols = "!@#$%^&*()_+[]{}|;:,.<>?";

function generatePassword(length = 12) {
  const allChars = upper + lower + numbers + symbols;
  let password = "";
  for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
    password += allChars[Math.floor(Math.random() * allChars.length)];
  }
  return password;
}
```
